# Forward Compatibility for the Scala 3 Transition
Scala 3 is coming, with a release candidate slated for the end of 2020.
With that knowledge comes the inevitable question:
should I migrate, and what is the potential cost?

For maintainers of projects, the migration process may become easier
with the release of Scala 2.13.4, which comes with a new feature:
reading and compiling against Scala 3 dependencies.

>To summarise: Scala 3 stores meta information about the code it compiles in
>TASTy files, and Scala 2.13 can read these files to learn, for example,

## Overview

With a guided tutorial, we will show you how to approach the following scenarios:
  - Using sbt, how you can migrate submodules to Scala 3 in any order and still
    be able to depend on them from upstream or downstream.
  - How you can continue to use in Scala 2.13 libraries that have
    released new updates for Scala 3.0.

A reader applying the steps in the tutorial to their own project should note that not all features of Scala 3 are
forward compatibile with Scala 2, such as `inline` methods. Consequently, we recommend that the user limits their usage of Scala 3 exclusive features when migrating incrementally.
More information is provided in the
[forward compatibility](#forward-compatibility) section.

In addition, we provide a [troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section for the reader, which aims to suggest steps to take when applying this guide to their own projects and a problem occurs.

## Scenarios

1. You have an application consisting of many subprojects that may depend on
each other, built with Scala 2.13, and would like to transition each one
independently to Scala 3.0
2. You have an application, built with Scala 2.13, and want to use some
new features of a library that has migrated to Scala 3.0

Let's take a look at each scenario in turn:

### Migrate a Multi-Module Project in Any Order

If you want to migrate a multi module project to Scala 3,
it does not matter in which order you migrate the modules, they will be
able to depend on each other regardless of whether they are compiled with
Scala 2.13 or Scala 3.

To illustrate this scenario, we will start with an empty directory and
build an sbt project with Scala 2.13 that has two modules, `shared`,
which has some common domain model data structures, and `app`,
which uses those data structures.

For this project, we will pick
[sbt 1.4.2](https://github.com/sbt/sbt/releases/tag/v1.4.2),
this allows you to mix projects of different Scala versions with very
little extra effort (thanks to Eugene Yokota).

This tutorial also assumes the release of Scala `3.0.0-M1`, but if you would
like to follow along today, you can [modify the build file](#early-access)
to use an early access snapshot release.

To begin, our project looks like the following:

```scala
// project/build.properties
sbt.version=1.4.2
```

```scala
// build.sbt

ThisBuild / scalaVersion := "2.13.4"

lazy val shared = project

lazy val app = project
  .dependsOn(shared)
```

```scala
// shared/src/main/scala/example/Cat.scala

package example

sealed trait Cat
object Cat {
  case object Lion    extends Cat
  case object Tiger   extends Cat
  case object Cheetah extends Cat
}
```

```scala
// app/src/main/scala/example/Main.scala

package example

object Main extends App {
  println(Cat.Tiger)
}
```

We can run this application with `sbt app/run` which will output the following:

```
[info] Compiling 1 Scala source to blog/shared/target/scala-2.13/classes ...
[info] Compiling 1 Scala source to blog/app/target/scala-2.13/classes ...
[info] running example.Main
Tiger
```

At this point we can try something exciting, compile either subproject with
Scala 3 and see if it works.

First, add the dotty plugin (this helps with managing and inspecting the
`scalaVersion` setting with Scala 3)

```scala
// project/plugins.sbt

addSbtPlugin("ch.epfl.lamp" % "sbt-dotty" % "0.4.5")
```

Then we can change the `scalaVersion` of `app`:

{% highlight diff %}
// build.sbt

 ThisBuild / scalaVersion := "2.13.4"

 lazy val shared = project

 lazy val app = project
   .dependsOn(shared)
+  .settings(scalaVersion := "3.0.0-M1")
{% endhighlight %}

To recap, `app` is now compiled by Scala 3 and depends on `shared`,
which is compiled by Scala 2.13.

If we do `sbt app/run` we should see the `app` project recompile
and it will run as before.

Now lets try the other way around, in this case we also have to enable
reading Scala 3 dependencies in Scala 2 with the flag `-Ytasty-reader`:

{% highlight diff %}
// build.sbt

 ThisBuild / scalaVersion := "2.13.4"

 lazy val shared = project
+  .settings(scalaVersion := "3.0.0-M1")

 lazy val app = project
   .dependsOn(shared)
-  .settings(scalaVersion := "3.0.0-M1")
+  .settings(scalacOptions += "-Ytasty-reader")
{% endhighlight %}

Here we have the opposite, `app` is compiled by Scala 2.13 and depends
on `shared`, which is compiled by Scala 3. We can see this more clearly using
the command `sbt 'show app/dependencyTree'`, which outputs the following:

```
app:app_2.13:0.1.0-SNAPSHOT [S]
  +-shared:shared_3.0.0-M1:0.1.0-SNAPSHOT
    +-org.scala-lang:scala3-library_3.0.0-M1:3.0.0-M1 [S]
```

If we then try `sbt app/run` both `shared` and `app` subprojects will recompile
and it should work as it always has. If in your own project there are issues
in changing the Scala versions, check out the
[troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section.

To summarise this part, we have shown that it is possible to migrate subprojects
to Scala 3 from Scala 2.13 in any order, gradually, and continue to build and
run them if they mix versions.

### Using a Scala 3 Library Dependency

> TODO:  there is currently no library published for Scala `3.0.0-M1`
> we can either rewrite this section to just explain it in principle,
> with a fake library or wait for some library to be available.

In the section above, we have seen how it is possible for a subproject compiled
with Scala 2.13 to depend on a subproject compiled with Scala 3. The same
relationship extends to library dependencies.

To demonstrate using a third party library dependency, we will add a dependency
on the fansi library to `app` and try to change our output to be colored blue:

{% highlight diff %}
// build.sbt

 ThisBuild / scalaVersion := "2.13.4"

 lazy val shared = project
   .settings(scalaVersion := "3.0.0-M1")

 lazy val app = project
   .dependsOn(shared)
+  .settings(
+    libraryDependencies += "com.lihaoyi" % "fansi_3.0.0-M1" % "0.2.9" // TODO fansi has not been published for `3.0.0-M1`
+  )
{% endhighlight %}

Notice that here, we are using the Scala 3 version of fansi, to force this,
we take a standard module id and change it as so:

{% highlight diff %}
-"com.lihaoyi" %% "fansi" % "0.2.9"
+"com.lihaoyi" % "fansi_3.0.0-M1" % "0.2.9"
{% endhighlight %}

By replacing `%%` with `%`, we can then manually specify the binary version,
leading us to add `_3.0.0-M1` to the name of the module.

We now update `Main.scala` to use the fansi library:

{% highlight diff %}
// app/src/main/scala/example/Main.scala

 package example

 object Main extends App {
-   println(Cat.Tiger)
+   println(fansi.Color.Blue(Cat.Tiger.toString))
 }
{% endhighlight %}

If we then use the command `sbt app/run` we should notice that "Tiger"
is now blue when printed.

If we then run again `sbt 'show app/dependencyTree'` we see the following:

```
app:app_2.13:0.1.0-SNAPSHOT [S]
  +-com.lihaoyi:fansi_3.0.0-M1:0.2.9
  | +-com.lihaoyi:sourcecode_3.0.0-M1:0.2.1
  |
  +-shared:shared_3.0.0-M1:0.1.0-SNAPSHOT
    +-org.scala-lang:scala3-library_3.0.0-M1:3.0.0-M1 [S]
```

To summarise, in this section we have shown how it is possible to use a
third party library dependency, compiled with Scala 3, from Scala 2.13.
If there are issues with changing the binary version of a particular
dependency you have, check out the [troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section.

## Forward Compatibility
When migrating a subproject to Scala 3, where downstream consuming subprojects are likely to be on Scala 2.13, we would recommend restricting the usage of new features in Scala 3. This will maximise compatibility as you migrate each subproject. However, it is possible to start using some features of Scala 3 without issue, this is due to a limited forward compatibility in Scala 2.13 with some new Scala 3 features.

Forward compatibility means that many definitions created by using new Scala 3 features
can be used from Scala 2.13, however they will be remapped to features
that exist in Scala 2.13. For example,
[extension methods](http://dotty.epfl.ch/docs/reference/contextual/extension-methods.html)
can only be used as ordinary methods. So for cross-compatible code we recommend
to continue using implicit classes to encode extension methods.

On the other hand, some features of Scala 3 are not mappable to features in Scala 2.13,
and will cause a compile-time error when using them. A longer list can be seen in the
migration guide, describing [how Scala 2 reacts to different Scala 3 features](https://scalacenter.github.io/scala-3-migration-guide/docs/compatibility.html#the-scala-2-tasty-reader).

For unsupported features, a best effort is made
to report errors at the use-site that is problematic. For example,
[match types](http://dotty.epfl.ch/docs/reference/new-types/match-types.html)
are not supported. If we define in the `shared` project the type `Elem`:

```scala
// shared/src/main/scala/example/MatchTypes.scala
package example

object MatchTypes {
  type Elem[X] = X match {
    case List[t] => t
    case Array[t] => t
  }
}
```

and then try to use it in the `app` project:

```scala
// app/src/main/scala/example/TestMatchTypes.scala
package example

object TestMatchTypes {
  def test: MatchTypes.Elem[List[String]] = "hello"
}
```

we get the following error when calling `sbt app/run`:

```
[error] TestMatchTypes.scala:5:25: Unsupported Scala 3 match type in bounds of type Elem; found in object example.MatchTypes.
[error]   def test: MatchTypes.Elem[List[String]] = "hello"
[error]                        ^
[error] one error found
```

The error is standard for all unsupported Scala 3 features, naming the feature,
the location of the definition and the location where it is used.

## Troubleshooting
There are some situations where the steps described in the sections above do
not work out of the box for your own project, and some other considerations
need to be made.

For the multi module project scenario, let's say you have two subprojects
`A` and `B`, where `B` depends on `A`, both compiled with Scala 2.13.

### Source Incompatibilities When Changing to Scala 3
If you change the `scalaVersion` of `A` to Scala 3 and `A` fails to build,
and the error is not due to a missing dependency, the source code of `A` may
be incompatible with Scala 3 and you will have to make some changes.
You can consult the [Scala 3 Migration Guide](https://scalacenter.github.io/scala-3-migration-guide/)
to see what changes may be required.

### Missing Scala 3 Dependencies
If you change the `scalaVersion` of `A` to Scala 3 and `A` fails to build
due to a missing dependency, you can try to use the Scala 2.13 version of
the dependency. The sbt-dotty plugin provides
[helper methods](https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty-example-project#getting-your-project-to-compile-with-dotty)
for this.

### Scala 3 Dependencies That Break Compilation

If you successfully migrate subproject `A` to Scala 3, but now `B` fails
to compile, there are several likely possibilities:

1. `A` has made a deliberate but [forward compatible](#forward-compatibility)
change to its API, and `B` needs to update to use the new API.
2. `A`, or a transitive dependency of `A`, uses a feature of Scala 3 that
is not [forwards compatible](#forward-compatibility) with Scala 2.13.
2. `A`, or a transitive dependency of `A`, defines a Scala 3
macro but does not provide an equivalent Scala 2 macro (see an
[example project](https://github.com/scalacenter/mix-macros-scala-2-and-3)
here for how to provide macros to Scala 2.13 from Scala 3.)
4. There is a bug in the implementation of reading Scala 3 dependencies
in Scala 2.13. [Please report here](https://github.com/scala/bug).

### Scala 3 Dependencies that Break Runtime Behaviour

If you successfully migrate subproject `A` to Scala 3, and `B` compiles
successfully, but now fails at runtime, there are two likely possibilities:

1. The definitions in the Scala 3 dependency were correctly read, but
perhaps the API changed subtly, so the code of `B` must adapt.
For example, perhaps a default implicit value has been replaced, or other
code has changed its implementation while using the same signature.
2. There is a bug in the implementation of reading Scala 3 dependencies
in Scala 2.13. [Please report here](https://github.com/scala/bug).

### Third Party Scala 3 Dependencies that Break Compilation/Runtime
If depending on a third party library, compiled with Scala 3, breaks
compilation, or disrupts runtime behaviour, please consider the above
troubleshooting topics, but instead assume that `A` is the third party
library, and `B` is your Scala 2.13 project that depends on it.

## Contributing

If you have found an issue with Scala 3 dependencies in Scala 2.13 and want to try
fixing it in the Scala 2 compiler, you can see a summary of how to work on the
implementation here:
[Working with the Tasty Reader](https://github.com/scala/scala/blob/2.13.x/doc/internal/tastyreader.md#working-with-the-code)

## Summary

In this blog, we have outlined how it is possible to incrementally migrate a
project to Scala 3 while continuing to use all the parts together during the
transition. We encourage you to try out this process and let us know of any
issues with using Scala 3 dependencies from Scala 2.13.

## Early Access

If you would like to try out Scala 3 dependencies early, you can use a
snapshot version of Scala 3:

{% highlight diff %}
// build.sbt
 ...
  lazy val shared = project
-  .settings(scalaVersion := "3.0.0-M1")
+  .settings(scalaVersion := "3.0.0-M1-bin-20201029-1f433d5-NIGHTLY")
 ...
{% endhighlight %}
